ðŸš§ Repo documentation under construction ðŸš§


This repo includes code for 4 state-of-the-art automatic augmentation algorithms adjusted to H&E stained histopathology. We provide training code with found augmentation policies, and transforms. The search code is a subtree of original repositories. 

You might also find interesting our preliminary work [Tailoring automated data augmentation to H&E-stained histopathology](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/pathology-he-auto-augment).
